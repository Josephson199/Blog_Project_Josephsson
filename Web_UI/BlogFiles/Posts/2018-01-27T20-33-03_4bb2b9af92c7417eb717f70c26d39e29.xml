  <Title>Recruiting Trends 2018</Title>
  <Body>
In terms of recruiting trends, 2017 was the year of AI and automation technologies, bias and workplace diversity, as well as candidate experience in recruiting.




What will the new year bring in tech recruitment?
### #1 Increased volume hiring
In 2017, roughly 60% of most recruitment teams predicted that their volume hiring will increase during 2018.




A recent survey by [Indeed](http://blog.indeed.com/2017/11/27/employer-outlook-2018-survey/) found that hiring will continue to increase in 2018: 61% of recruiters expect to hire more people in 2018 than they did in 2017, while 29% expect to maintain current headcount, and only 10% are planning to reduce their hiring.




Increased hiring means busier recruiting teams and the need for additional resources such as investment in recruitment tech that addresses your specific pain points..
### #2 Focus on conversation rates in sourcing, not **numbers**.
SocialTalentâ€™s latest [Global Recruiting Survey](https://www.socialtalent.com/blog/recruitment/2017-global-recruiting-survey) found the average recruiter sourced 225 candidates for a single hire, an overall conversion rate of 0.4%. Top performing recruiters, on the other hand, were 150% more efficient. They sourced 91 candidates on average for one hire for an overall conversion rate of 1.0%.




In 2018, one of the top recruiting trends will be a focus on quality over quantity.




Talent acquisition leaders are less impressed by absolute numbers and instead will be looking for how well their recruiters can optimize their conversion rates and reduce time to fill to outperform their competitors in landing talent.
